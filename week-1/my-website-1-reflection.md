•Paste a link to your [USERNAME].github.io repository: http://sfinkenhdz.github.io/

•Explain how to create a repository on GitHub and clone the repository to your local computer to a non-technical person.
First, I'd explain the difference between git and GitHub.
To create a new repository (which is like a folder but it lives on the web), just click the "+" in the top right corner. Then, create a name and type it into the box under "Repository name". Select public or private (usually public), add a license and click "Create repository".
To bring a copy of your new repo to your computer, copy the URL in the box next to "HTML". Then, go to your terminal and navigate to where you'd like to save your repo. (A quick lesson about the command line would probably be needed here.) Type: git clone and paste the URL. Then, hit "Enter". Now, you have a clone of your repo on your computer.


•Describe what open source means.
Open source refers to software that is available for anyone to use, copy, modify and redistribute for free. The idea is to support collaboration among developers.

•What do you think about Open Source? Does it make you nervous or protective? Does it feel like utopia? For the most part, it sounds great. I love the idea of everyone sharing and collaborating to make the best things possible for anyone to use. It doesn't make me feel protective, as in this is mine and you can't use it. It does make me wonder about the line between freely distributing certain software vs making money off of a product into which someone has invested time and effort. I'd love to live in a socialist utopia where this didn't matter, but unfortunately we don't.

•Assess the importance of using licenses. There's a proverb that says "Good fences make good neighbors". I think licenses are important for a similar reason. Having clear boundaries about what's yours and mine, or the conditions under which you can use something I've created prevent unnecessary disputes and help maintain positive relationships.

•What concepts were solidified in the challenge? Did you have any "aha" moments? What did you struggle with? I feel like this challenge helped solidify much of the other week 1 work, especially git and GitHub. I can see how the various parts fit together, and just going through the process a few times if helping me feel more comfortable with the steps. I feel like I had maybe half or two-thirds of an "ah-ha" moment. Things are much more clear, but it's more something that is happening over time and practice than in one moment. I didn't feel like I struggled too much with this challenge. I was a little surprised with how smoothly things worked, and then I got to the end, and thought - Whoa, I'm done already?! Maybe that was my ah-ha moment.  

•Did you find any resources on your own that helped you better understand a topic? If so, please list it.
Not specifically for this challenge, but I looked at these for clarification on forks vs. branches:
