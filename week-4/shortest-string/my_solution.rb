# Shortest String

# I worked on this challenge by myself.

# shortest_string is a method that takes an array of strings as its input
# and returns the shortest string
#
# +list_of_words+ is an array of strings
# shortest_string(array) should return the shortest string in the +list_of_words+
#
# If +list_of_words+ is empty the method should return nil

#Your Solution Below
#My pseudo-code is one way to do this, I think, although there may be a better or easier approach.
#Couldn't figure out the code.


def shortest_string(list_of_words)

  list_of_words.each do |word|
    word_length << [word.length]

  Hash.new {|list_of_words, word_length| list_of_words[word_length] =
}


end


# takes an array of strings
# for each string, count the length
# print word, length
# put word and length into a hash
#   numbers = key
# if hash has key 1
#   print value
