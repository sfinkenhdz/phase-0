# Shortest String

# I worked on this challenge by myself.

# shortest_string is a method that takes an array of strings as its input
# and returns the shortest string
#
# +list_of_words+ is an array of strings
# shortest_string(array) should return the shortest string in the +list_of_words+
#
# If +list_of_words+ is empty the method should return nil

#Your Solution Below
def shortest_string(list_of_words)
  # Your code goes here!
  list_of_words.each do |word|
    word.length




def total(array)
    answer = 0
    array.each do |num|
        answer += num
    end
    p answer
end

end


takes an array of strings
for each string, count the length
print word, length
put word and length into a hash
  numbers = key
if hash has key 1
  print value
