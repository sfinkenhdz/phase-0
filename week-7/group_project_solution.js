// SUM:
// As a user, I want to create a Function called "sum"
// that returns the sum of a group of numbers. The
// sum should be returned in two scenarious: if the
// group has an odd amount of numbers AND an even
// amount of numnbers.


//Pseudocode:
/*
CREATE a function "sum" that takes an array of integers as its parameter.
CREATE a variable "total."
ITERATE through the array, adding each element together,a nd set this amount equal to "total."
IF the length of the array divided by two equals 0, return "There is an even amount of numbers. Their sum is "total"."
ELSE return "There is an odd amount of numbers. Their sum is "total"."
*/

//Initial Solution:




// MEAN:
// As a user, I want to create a Function called "mean"
// that returns the mean of a group of numbers. The
// mean should be returned in two scenarios: when the
// group has an odd amount of numbers AND an even
// amount of numnbers.

//Pseudocode:
/*
CREATE a function "mean" that takes an array of integers as its parameter.
CREATE a variable "n" and set it equal to the length of the array.
CREATE a variable "total."
ITERATE through the array, adding each element together,a nd set this amount equal to "total."
CREATE a variable "average" and set it equal to "n"/"total."
IF n divided by two equals 0, return "There is an even amount of numbers. Their mean is "average"."
ELSE return "There is an odd amount of numbers. Their mean is "average"."
*/



//Initial Solution:




// MEDIAN:
// As a user, I want to create a Function called "median"
// that returns the median of a group of numbers. The
// median should be returned in two scenarios: when the
// group has an odd amount of numbers AND an even
// amount of numnbers.



//Pseudocode:
/*
CREATE a function "med" that takes an array of integers as its parameter.
SORT the array.
CREATE a variable "length" that equals the length of the array.
CREATE a variable "halfLength" that equals length/2.
CREATE a variable "median."
IF length % 2 = 0,
  "median" = (array[halfLength] + array[halfLength - 1])/2
  RETURN "There is an even amount of numbers. Their sum is "median.""
ELSE
  "median" = array[halfLength.floor]
  RETURN "There is an odd amount of numbers. Their median is "median.""
