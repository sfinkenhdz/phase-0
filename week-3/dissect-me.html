You could think about GitHub as the place where all the gits hang out, but the real answer is a little more complicated. And, perhaps the better question is: what are they all doing there?

<!--
  1. In this challenge, we used main, footer, nav, and section. I have found that I use main and nav the most. Any website should have a main section, and most of what I have been working on also has a navigation bar. I have also used header/footer, section and aside fairly often.
  2. Elements are laid out and displayed from top to bottom.
  3. I learned that you can make snippets in Sublime. I will definitely both create and research snippets more in the future. Already, I can see that there are many times when I am using the same chunk of code repeatedly and it will be a huge time-saver to be able to use snippets. -->
