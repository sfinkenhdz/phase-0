<!-- 
- What was it like to translate your previous learning with HTML into an actual site? I think it was useful to use what we learned to create the html for an actual site. It helped show how to apply what we learned. And, the more I practice using something, the better I'm able to understand and remember it.


- How was it researching and using semantic HTML5 elements?
The more I researched, the more they make sense and seem bery useful. At first it just seemed like more things to remember, but as I've started to understand the differences, they now seems like useful ways to get a more specific idea across.

- How did you do at keeping to best practices (i.e. no formatting in the HTML)
This wasn't hard at all. I went through the CodeAcademy HTML/CSS course before starting Phase 0, so the different purposes for the two languages and how they work together makes sense to me. It also makes a lot of sense to keep formatting separate, so you have a simple way of making an overall change without going back and changing each individual piece in HTML.

- What seems good and bad about HTML?
It certainly seems useful to have a way to structure a website. When I've looked at HTML before understanding what it means, it seems difficult to understand, so maybe it could be more readable to someone withtout programming knowledge. However, now that I have even a basic understanding, it doesn't seem that complicated. Something I have always wondered though, is why we need something like this. Why can't we just design a site using something that you use like a word processor? I know this makes me sound like a total amateur, but hey, I am a total amateur. I'm starting to understand this, but still can't quite articulate it. 

- What tricks do you have for remembering how to write HTML?
My two big tricks are taking notes and practicing. I learn best by writing and by doing, and my memory just isn't as good as it was 10 years ago. I've been taking a ton of notes over the last couple of weeks, both because it helps me retain the info and so that I can refer back later when I forget a certain command or something. And, the more I practice, the more it becomes natural.
