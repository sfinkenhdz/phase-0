# Identify and describe the Ruby method(s) you implemented.
# '.grep' = an Enumerable method that iterates over a specified array (in this case, source). It then searches through that array for all expressions that contain what the user is looking for (in this case a letter within a string), and returns a new array of those expressions that contain what the user is looking for.
# '.select!' (aka '.keep_if') = an Array/Hash method that iterates over an array or hash (in this case a hash). If the block of code within the method returns true, an array containing those items is returned. In other words, it deletes all items within the array that don't meet the conditions set within '.select!'.
# '.keys' = a Hash method that returns a new array populated with the keys from the hash (In the case of this challenge, it returns an array of only those keys that contain a value equal to the age specified when "my_hash_finding_method" is called).

def my_array_modification_method!(source, thing_to_modify)
    source.each_index do |x|

# Identify and describe the Ruby method(s) you implemented.
#    For the array, I iterated through the elements using the .each_index method. For each index, I checked
#    if the element was an integer. If so, I incremented the element's value using the += method. Had I used
#    the .each method, and then incremented the value of x, the changes would be non-destructive due to x being
#    a local variable. Making a change to source[x] instead modifies the original array, causing destructive
#    behavior required by the instructions.
#
#    For the hash, I used the each method to iterate the hash by key-value pairs, and then used the =+ method
#    to increment again. Changing the value of source{key} is a destructive action.

# Identify and describe the Ruby method(s) you implemented.

# As you can see from my notes, the array solution is complicated. I wanted to understand how the .sort method works,
# without using it.
# Let me run you through it, each_index simply pulls the index of each element (0, 1, 2, 3 ect).
# Then, we set up a second loop to select the next one (first + 1) and assign it to second. (first + 1...8) establishes our
# flow. The comparison itself is by comparing each element in the array to each other, and swapping their positions if
# the "first" is greater than the "second".

# example

# array = [2, 4, 3, 1]
# 2 > 4 false
# 2 > 3 false
# 2 > 1 true
# array = [1, 4, 3, 2]
# 4 > 3 true
# array = [1, 3, 4, 2]
# 3 > 2 true
# array = [1, 2, 4, 3]
# 4 > 3 true
# array = [1, 2, 3 ,4]


# In my_hash_sorting_method, I used .sort_by. You give the key and value conditional variables, and then choose which one to sort by

# Identify and describe the Ruby method(s) you implemented.
#  I used map!, to_s, include?, delete_if, and reject!
# map takes every element in an array, does to it whatever is specificed in the block it is given and then puts the modified elements into a new array. map! does the same thing, but is destructive, so it puts the modified elements back into the original array.
# to_s converts to a string. So, when combined with map! we get all elements in the original array transformed to strings.
# include? checks if a specified character or sub-string is included within a string.
# delete_if does exactly what it says. It deletes an element if a certain condition is met. So, in this example, when combined with include? delete_if iterates through each string in the array and deletes it if it includes the specified character.
# reject! is similar to delete_if, but is used with hashes. If the conditions in the code block are met, reject! rejects or deletes the corresponding key/value pair.
